# Colors 


Remember that color plays a critical role in your map visualization and data analysis. Color is used in design to attract attention, group similar elements, show meaning and enhance aesthetics. When used appropiately, color allows users to descern patterns and significant relationships within the data. Used inappropriately and these patterns and observations can easily be obscured or misleading. Below are a few resources - including guides, tutorials and tools - to help aid you in your color selections.
