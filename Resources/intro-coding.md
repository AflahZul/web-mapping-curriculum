# Introduction HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

If you've ever started taking web development courses then you have probably been introduced to an analogy or two that help to explain the structure of a website. A common analogy used to do this is by comparing a website to a house. Where: 

HTML is like the structure or scaffolding of the building. An HTML file contains the structure of the page itself. 

CSS is like the design of the building. The CSS file allows you to change colors, positioning and more. 

JavaScript is like the the functionality of a home - the electricity, etc. A JavaScript file determines the dynamic and interactive elements on the page. It determines what happens when users click, hover or type within certain elements.
