# Class Project 

The final project is an opportunity to demonstrate your understanding of the web-mapping and cartographic topics that we covered throughout this course. For the final project, each team will select a project topic - fracking, fires, or  housing/homelesness, and then plan, design and develop a web mapping application with basic interactions and controls. 

The final project will have 4 components:

1. Project proposal (10 points) – 1-2 paragraphs outlining the project scope and purpose. 
2. Data report (15 points) – a report on the data resources and data visualization techniques that will be employed. 
3. Presentation (15 points) - Brief (no more than 5 minutes) presenation outlining: the plan and purpose of the project, the intended audience, a description of the data resources and preparation, a description of the development of the application, and an overview of the issues encountered while completing the project. In addition, students should be prepared to give a live demo of their web application.
4. Final web application and summary report (30 points) - The final web application should demonstrate the cartographic and web mapping principles covered in the class and should employ at least one of the data visualization techniques outined below. In addition to a web application, students are required to write a summary report outlining: the plan and purpose of the project, the intended audience, a description of the data resources and preparation, a description of the development of the application, and an overview of the issues encountered while completing the project.

### Project topics and data 

For the purposes of this class students will choose 1 of 3 topics - fracking, fires, housing/homelessness - for the development of their web application. We have curated three collections for the class, however, students are not limited to the data that has been provided and a free to integrate additional datasets into their final design.
