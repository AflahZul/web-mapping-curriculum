# Class Project 

The final project is an opportunity to demonstrate your understanding of the web-mapping and cartographic topics that we covered throughout this course. For the final project, each team will select a project topic - fracking, fires, or  housing/homelesness, and then plan, design and develop a web mapping application with basic interactions and controls. 

The final project will have 4 components:

1. Project proposal (10 points) – 1-2 paragraphs outlining the project scope and purpose. 

2. Data report (15 points) – a report on the data resources and data visualization techniques that will be employed. 

3. Presentation (15 points) - Brief (no more than 5 minutes) presenation outlining: the plan and purpose of the project, the intended audience, a description of the data resources and preparation, a description of the development of the application, and an overview of the issues encountered while completing the project. In addition, students should be prepared to give a live demo of their web application.

4. Final web application and summary report (30 points) - The final web application should demonstrate the cartographic and web mapping principles covered in the class and should employ at least one of the data visualization techniques outined below. In addition to a web application, students are required to write a summary report outlining: the plan and purpose of the project, the intended audience, a description of the data resources and preparation, a description of the development of the application, and an overview of the issues encountered while completing the project.

### Project topics and data 

For the purposes of this class students will choose 1 of 3 topics - fracking & groundwater, fires & landcover, housing & homelessness - for the development of their web application. Data collections have been curated for the class, however, are free to integrate additional datasets into their final design. 

__California Fires and Landcover__

- Data: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-EJsze2SEx5g1CA2Fj1u6R9IT1xhq1hK

- Data sources: 

  __Fire perimeters in California:__
  https://frap.fire.ca.gov/frap-projects/fire-perimeters/
  Landcover & Statistics:
  Source: Data Basin EnviroAtlas
  Description: 
  Percent Natural Land: This dataset represents the percentage of land area that is classified as forest land cover, modified   forest land cover, and natural land cover using the 2006 National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) for each Watershed Boundary       Dataset (WBD)12-digit hydrological unit (HUC) in the conterminous United States. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to   support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (http://enviroatlas.epa.gov/EnviroAtlas)   allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem         services for the contiguous United States. <br>
  The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map       service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas 
  Fact Sheet (http://enviroatlas.epa.gov/EnviroAtlas/DataFactSheets). 
  
  __California wildlife habitat relationships:__
  This layer is the land-cover/land use data compiled for the California Gap Analysis Project. It contains vegetation           attributes for landscape scale map units, including canopy dominant species, canopy density, presence of regional endemic     species, and inclusion of wetland habitats. Although polygons are classified into several schema (California Natural           Diversity Data Base or "Holland" system,California Wildlife Habitat Relationships habitat types), data on presence of         dominant canopy species are provided to allow customized classifications to meet a user's needs.

  __Fracking Well locations:__
  Source: California Department of Conservation via FractTracker
  Description: CA – DOGGR – All California oil and gas wells (development and prospect wells), enhanced-recovery wells, water-   disposal wells, service wells (i.e. structure, observation, temperature observation wells), core-holes, and gas-storage       wells, onshore and offshore (within three nautical miles of the coastline), located on state and private lands, are           administered by California’s Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR). Data related to this activity can be       accessed through DOGGR’s online resources. To obtain information on stimulated wells in California, however, datasets often   have to be aggregated from multiple sources.
