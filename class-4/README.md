2. Why is it possible for Mapbox GL JS to place labels dynamically as you interact with the map?

**Jurisdiction finder recap**
_For the following 3 prompts, reference the working file and README.md in [the jurisdiction finder explanation folder in the main class repo](https://github.com/mapbox/web-mapping-curriculum/tree/master/class-4/in-class-exercises/jurisdiction-finder-explanation)_.
1. Describe how `feature` gets to the `makeFeatureLabel()` function.
2. What does the `getDistrictNumber()` function do?
3. Looking at the [callback](https://codeburst.io/javascript-what-the-heck-is-a-callback-aba4da2deced) to `map.on('click',...)`, what is `e` and why do we need it?

Code exercises:
_For each of the following 2 prompts, commit an html file to the "class 4" folder in your class repo._
1. Using geojson.io, trace the outline of your childhood home. Using the skills we’ve learned in class, add your new GeoJSON to a Mapbox GL JS map.
2. Building off of the previous exercise, add functionality that changes the color of the layer you just added when the user clicks on it.



### Project

This week, you should prepare your second progress report. This is a minimal check-in that should include, at a minimum:

1. What you worked on this week.
2. Any changes you’ve made to your original proposal.
3. A description of what you’ve built so far and, if applicable, a link to code (it’s ok if it doesn’t work!)
4. Any obstacles you need to overcome before you can move on to the next step.

To turn in your progress report, open an issue in your forked version of the class repo. The issue title should start with “[Progress report]” to let us know that it’s a progress report. 

Include all of the above bullets and feel free to say “not applicable” if needed. Include any relevant links to code, data, or resources.
