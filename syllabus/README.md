**COURSE DESCRIPTION:** Welcome to Introduction to Web Mapping with Mapbox! Mapbox is a mapping company that provides the location data platform for many widely used mobile and web applications. Mapbox provides the building blocks (APIs and SDKs) to add location features like maps, search, and navigation to any web experience you create. This 8-week course will introduce students to the basics of web mapping technologies including:  web programming, cartographic principles for web and mobile development, GitHub project management, and documentation literacy. In addition to laboratory exercises and assignments, students will develop a class project that employs all of the skills developed throughout this course. No prior programming experience is required, but students should know that the course will teach the basics of selected programming languages.

**INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES**
The course will be presented using a variety of teaching methods including lectures, class
Discussion, in-class exercises, and group projects. Assignments are outlined below; details will be provided on the class Canvas site.
 
**HOW STUDENT LEARNING WILL BE EVALUATED**
Assessment will be based on completion of in-class exercises, assignments and a final project.  Note:  All assignments and project-based work are expected to be completed in the semester in which they are started. Incomplete grades will only be given in extreme circumstances (e.g. death in the family, hospitalization, giving birth, etc.).
 
**GRADING**

***Attendance, Preparation and Participation*** **(15% of grade).**

- Attendance:  Students are expected to attend all classes. Given the heavy use of in-class interactive activities, it is difficult to make up for missed class time. Please email the
instructors in advance if you need to miss class. Alternate in class exercises will only be allowed in extreme circumstances at the instructors’ discretion.

- Class preparation: Students will complete all required assignments before coming to class.

- Participation. Students are expected to participate in all class activities — discussions, presentations, group activities, etc.
 
***Assignments for the course*** **(50% of grade)** 

Each week students will be assigned homework that build on topics covered during the week’s lecture/class exercise materials.

- Class assignments and homework build upon each other, so it is important to be up to date on your assignments and to participate in class.
- Assignments that are not submitted properly will be returned to the student.
- Re-grading of assignments is done only in exceptional cases and must be coordinated with the instructor within one week of the assignment being returned.  The entire assignment will be re-graded in such cases.
- Alternate assignments will only be allowed in extreme circumstances at the instructors’ discretion.

 
***Final Project*** **(35%)** 

The final project is designed to reflect students’ proficiency over the web-mapping and cartographic topics covered in this course.  Students will work in groups and choose from a set of topics. 
 
All assignments (lab exercises and project work) will be submitted online via the class GitHub site. Due dates will be listed on the class Canvas Site and the GitHub homepage README.
 
Students are strongly encouraged to contact the instructors before the due date to discuss an extension if they will not be able to complete an assignment on time. Without an extension, late assignments will be penalized 5% per day late.
