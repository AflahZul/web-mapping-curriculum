## Homework

### For your class journal (2 points each):

**Intro to interactivity**

* What are some strategies interactive map developers can use to ensure maps with a lot of interactions are not overwhelming?
* Why do we use the term “map user” instead of “map reader?”

**Common types of interaction**

* What is geocoding and how might you add it to an interactive map?

**Intro to events**

* What is an event?
* Describe an example of how you could use an event listener with an interactive map.


### Code exercises to do on your own (10 points):

* Starting from your marker-and-popup map, add a button that, when clicked, causes the map to fly to Walla Walla, Washington.

## Project
By now you should have a project proposal that includes your topic, a description of your audience, and some idea of the data you’ll be using.

This week, you should prepare your first progress report. This is a minimal check-in that should include, at a minimum:
* What you worked on.
* Any changes you’ve made to your original proposal.
* A description of what you’ve built so far and, if applicable, a link to code (it’s ok if it doesn’t work!)
* Any obstacles you need to overcome before you can move on to the next step.

**How to turn in your progress report**:
Open an issue in your forked version of the class repo. The issue title should start with “[Progress report]” to let us know that it’s a progress report. 

Include all of the bullets to the left (feel free to say “not applicable” if needed) and any relevant links to code, data, or resources.
